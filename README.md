## Topic: Diabetes Risk Prediction Models Based on Regression Analysis
### Computing language: R


### Background
* The prevalence of diabetes has steadily increased worldwide, with a particularly steep increase in populations over 65 years old.
* Many factors have been identified to independently affect prevalence of diabetes, such as increasing age, certain comorbidity, race, BMI. 
* While most of the studies look for only one or two independent predictors, we suspect that the association between HbA1c and physiological risk factors are complex and multimodal.


### Methods
* Linear Modelling
  * Additive/Flexible Modelling
  * Multiple Linear Regression
  * Interaction Effects
  * Non-linear Effects 
* Logistic Modelling
* Multinomial Logistic Modelling
* Ordinal Logistic Modelling
* Secondary Analysis
